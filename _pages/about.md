I'm a graduate computer science student at Indiana University Bloomington.My intellectual hunger stays alive pondering on a question – what did you learn today which you did not know yesterday?–. While contributing my drop in the ocean, I focus on research areas of machine learning, distributed systems.

I'm part of CREST(Center for Research in Extreme Scale Technologies) lab researching techniques for edge computing on resource constrained devices. 

Prior to joining Indiana University, I worked as a data scientist at SAP for 2.5 years.

When I'm not coding, I hike, read.
