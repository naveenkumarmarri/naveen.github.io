I'm a graduate computer science student at Indiana University Bloomington, I focus on research areas of machine learning, distributed systems.

I'm part of reasearch group researching on edge computing on resource constrained devices. 

Prior to joining Indiana University, I worked as a data scientist at SAP for 2.5 years.

When I'm not coding, I hike, read.
