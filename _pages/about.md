I'm a graduate computer science student at Indiana University Bloomington.I'm part of CREST(Center for Research in Extreme Scale Technologies) lab researching techniques for edge computing on resource constrained devices. 

Prior to joining Indiana University, I worked as a data scientist at SAP for 2.5 years. My main areas of interests are machine learning, distributed systems.

When I'm not coding, I hike, read.
